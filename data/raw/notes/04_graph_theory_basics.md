# Graph Theory Basics (what you must know)

## Graph types
- **Directed** vs **undirected**
- **Simple** vs **multigraph** vs **pseudograph** (multiple edges, loops)
- **Labeled graphs**: nodes/edges with attributes

## Core notions
- **Degree** (undirected), **in-degree/out-degree** (directed)
- **Adjacency**: two nodes connected by an edge (direction matters)
- **Path**: sequence of consecutive edges; in directed graphs, follows direction

## Typical network families
- Random
- Small-world (short path lengths)
- Scale-free (power-law degrees)

## Graph tasks taxonomy
- **Exploration / path finding** (BFS, shortest paths)
- **Centrality / importance** (degree, closeness, betweenness, eigenvector/PageRank)
- **Community detection** (connected components, label propagation, clustering coefficient)
